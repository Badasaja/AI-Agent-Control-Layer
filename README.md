This is an experimental practice to respond to 금융감독원's [금융분야 AI 활용 가이드라인],
especially to control the probabilistic nature of agentic systems. 
Following the philosophy of the original paper, 
this code enforces a semi-deterministic 'process' in the execution of a LLM process. 

[DISCLOSURE]
Most of the codes are heavily reliant on generative AI, and is not intended for commercial use
